                        <h1>EXTINCT</h1>
                        <p>
                            Extinct is a blog created as my project exam for spring 2022. Content is set up in and retrieved from an API and displayed in a dynamic way with a carousel, the ability to load more posts and validation of contact forms with Javascript. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Requirements for the blog is that content should be set up in a headless CMS such as WordPress, have at least 12 blog posts, display “latest posts” in a carousel on the homepage, load more posts on the blog-page and be able to click images to see larger versions with a modal. To show a post specific page it must be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on the post the user clicked on. Contact form must be validated with JavaScript and give feedback to the user on whether it was valid or not. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>ASSESMENT:</h2>
                        <p>
                            The target audience of the blog is quite wide, therefore the design is kept simple and clean. This way the content can speak for itself and be the main focus on the site. I didn't have very much experience with JavaScript at this point so I found it a bit challenging to create a website this way. I did learn a lot about how it works and all the possibilities that lie in  creating a website like this. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To improve the site I would like to add a filter to the blog-page so that it's possible to choose a category. Also I would probably make the carousel a bit different with better functionality. It would also be nice to add more information to the modal when clicking an image like title and X to close the modal. The feedback for the contact form could be more clear, maybe with color usage or something like that. Overall I am happy with the result and think it has great potential to keep improving it.

                        <p>
                            For planning I made a Trello Board alongside a GANTT chart. I did some research on my target audience and visited similar websited then established what my blog was going to need in terms of design and structure.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The design process started on paper and later became wireframes and prototype i Figma. This gave me opportunities to do some user testing early on in the process. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used VS Code to write my code in HTML and CSS before adding functionality with JavaScript. Finally I did user tests again with Hotjar and did smaller adjustments based on the feedback I got.
