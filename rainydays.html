                        <h1>RAINYDAYS</h1>
                        <p>
                            Rainydays is an online store made as a school project. The site should inspire the user to push their comfort zone as well as make it easy for the user to find and buy jackets fit for their next adventure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The requirements for this project was that it should have an appealing design for the target audience which was men and women aged 30 to 50. The jackets are mid-range in price and emphasize durability. The site should contain all necessary pages for an online store such as home, list of jackets, product specific page, checkout, checkout success, about and contact. The code should be semantic and neat and WCAG and SEO should be taken into account. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>ASSESMENT:</h2>
                        <p>
                            This was the first project we made with multiple pages and products. I had to make a plan for my progress in order to spend my time correctly in every phase of the project. I also got to practice using basic design principles and keeping the code neat and following the DRY principles for CSS. The site looks good on all devices but I experienced a few “bugs” on mobile such as buttons and input fields that look different from browser to browser. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To improve this site I would first of all add JavaScript to fetch products from an API to be able to get product specific pages for all products. I would also add a filter so that the user can narrow down the options. The forms could also be validated with JS and give feedback if the input was invalid or move on to order confirmation. Additionally I would add a carousel with news on the homepage and a functioning search bar.  
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <h2>PROCESS:</h2>
                        <p>
                            For planning I made a Trello Board alongside a GANTT chart. I did some research on my target audience and established what the site was going to need in terms of design and structure.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The design process started on paper and later became wireframes and prototype i Figma. This gave me opportunities to do some user testing early on in the process. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used VS Code to write my code in HTML and CSS. Finally I did user tests again and did smaller adjustments based on the feedback I got.
