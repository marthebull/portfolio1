                        <h1>COMMUNITY SCIENCE MUSEUM</h1>
                        <p>
                            A website created for a Community Science Museum as a school project. The target group was young people between the ages of 7 and 15 and their adults. The site is designed to engage and inspire the user to visit the museum as well as show what to expect when visiting. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Requirements for this website was that it should be responsive with an engaging design that appeals to the target audience. It should have at least 4-6 pages and only contain information and images provided. Images must be optimized and smaller than 200kb. The code should be semantic and neat and WCAG and SEO should be taken into account.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            HTML5, CSS, Figma, Netlify, GitHub, Adobe Photoshop, Procreate
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="margin">PROCESS:</h2>
                        <p>
                            I started out with planning and researching for the project. I made a Trello Board alongside a GANTT chart and found similar existing websites. I did some research on my target audience and established what the site was going to need in terms of design and structure. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The design process started on paper and later became wireframes and prototype i Figma. This gave me opportunities to do some user testing early on in the process. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used VS Code to write my code in HTML and CSS. The site was deployed to netlify right away so I could see the product on mobile and tablet while working to discover bugs that donâ€™t appear in the inspector on desktop. Finally I did user tests again and did smaller adjustments based on the feedback I got.
                        </p>

                            This was my project exam in the first semester and I think it turned out pretty good based on the knowledge I had at this point. I had a lot of fun designing this website as it was my first time creating a site for this target audience. I also had time to draw my own illustrations which I think was quite important for the expression and identity of the website. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I got to practice using basic design principles, communication technologies and developing with HTML and CSS. The site looks good on all devices and I learned a lot about media queries and responsive design through this project. I saw great progress regarding this from my previous project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course there is always room for improvement. If I was to do this over I would definitely add JavaScript to get a functioning search bar and carousels, improve the hamburger menu and validate contact form. I could also set up content in a headless CMS like WordPress and fetch this with JS to get specific pages for each exhibition. There's also a few things I would change regarding the design like adding "home" to the menu, only use hero image on the homepage and maybe change up the images a bit along with better optimization of these.
