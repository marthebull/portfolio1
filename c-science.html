                        <h1>COMMUNITY SCIENCE MUSEUM</h1>
                        <p>
                            A website created for a Community Science Museum as a school project. The target group was young people between the ages of 7 and 15 and their adults. The site is designed to engage and inspire the user to visit the museum as well as show what to expect when visiting. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Requirements for this website was that it should be responsive with an engaging design that appeals to the target audience. It should have at least 4-6 pages and only contain information and images provided. Images must be optimized and smaller than 200kb. The code should be semantic and neat and WCAG and SEO should be taken into account.  
                        </p>

                        <h2>ASSESMENT:</h2>
                        <p>
                            This was my project exam in the first semester. I had a lot of fun designing this website as it was my first time creating a site for this target audience. I got to practice using basic design principles, communication technologies and developing with HTML and CSS. The site looks good on all devices and I learned a lot about media queries and responsive design through out this project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course there is always room for improvement. If I was to do this over I would definitely add JavaScript to get a functioning search bar and carousels, improve the hamburger menu and validate contact form. I could also set up content in a headless CMS like WordPress and fetch this with JS to get specific pages for each exhibition. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>PROCESS:</h2>
                        <p>
                            For planning I made a Trello Board alongside a GANTT chart. I did some research on my target audience and established what the site was going to need in terms of design and structure.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The design process started on paper and later became wireframes and prototype i Figma. This gave me opportunities to do some user testing early on in the process. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used VS Code to write my code in HTML and CSS. Finally I did user tests again and did smaller adjustments based on the feedback I got.
